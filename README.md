# CG3M-Sholl

Confocal images taken by Daniel Gahn.
Data quantified by Paul Tobin using SNT sholl analysis. 
  Astrocytes were filtered, binarized then counted in concentric rings. 
  Pixel scale was .09655um/px, and rings had step size of 2px (possibly different)

MATLAB code takes excel file as input, each column title has animal ID as "Animal <#>"
MATLAB code quantifies astrocyte size, astrocyte sholl characteristics. And saves data as .mat file
